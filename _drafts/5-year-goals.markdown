My 5-year goals: 

1. Read [Jaynes' Probability Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Theory-The-Logic-Science/dp/0521592712). Have a very strong grasp of Bayesian methods.
2. Finish reading [GEB](http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1396997977&sr=1-1&keywords=godel+escher+bach).
3. Do a software engineering internship at a Google-caliber-company.
4. Do a research internship at an industrial (IBM, MS) lab.
5. Get (or work towards) a PhD in a robotics, machine learning related field. [Bonus: Study a topic with possible practical applications.]
6. Lean a functional programming language very well (possibly Haskell or Scheme). [Bonus: Read [SICP](http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1396998524&sr=1-1&keywords=structure+and+interpretation+of+computer+programs)
7. Maintain a blog with technical/academic content.
