###Stress and Willpower is inversely correlated
It made sense to rely on instincts rather than cold calculation when our ancestors were under stress. Relying on instincts saves time and results in better behavior (e.g., when you notice a tiger approaching you in a savanna). However, in modern life causes of stress are not acute but chronic. Hence, supressing the prefrontal cortex and favoring instincts do not result in optimal behavior for solving stresses of modern life. In fact, because stress short-circuits the prefrontal cortex and willpower relies on the prefrontal cortex, we can say willpower and stress are inversely correlated.
