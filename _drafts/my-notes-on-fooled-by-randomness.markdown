I enjoyed reading the book. Altough most concepts were not new to me, Taleb offers some refreshing insights. 

Below, I list some of my notes from the book.

Arguments that cannot be simplified into media-friendly statements are often confused by people and considered to be symptops of a confused mind.

It is rational to change what one believes under the light of new information (*.i.e. Bayes rule*). However, most people usually stick to their ideas. This behavior can be explained by evolutionary arguments (*as most things*): "Think about the consequences of being a trader outside of the market activity, and deciding every morning at 8 a.m. whether to keep the spouse or part with him or her for a better emotional investment elsewhere."

"Researchers found that purely ratioanl behavior on the part of humans can come from a defect in the amygdala that blocks the emotions of attachment, meaning that the subject is, literally, a pscyopath."

Mild success can be explained by skills and labor.
Wild success is attrituable to variance.
