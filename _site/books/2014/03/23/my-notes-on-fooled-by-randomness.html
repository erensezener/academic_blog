          <h2>My Notes on Fooled by Randomness</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I enjoyed reading the book. Altough most concepts were not new to me, Taleb offers some refreshing insights. </p>

<p>Main argument of the book is that most things in life are random. However, people don&#39;t see the randomness and find causal connections.
Taleb bashes the academics, scientists, and especially traders for being fools of randomess.</p>

<p>Below, I list some of my notes from the book:</p>

<p><em>Please note that, my notes do not necessarily reflect my beliefs but they some likely include my interpretations.</em></p>

<p>Taleb avoids watching or reading any news. He considers most news as noise.</p>

<p>Arguments that cannot be simplified into media-friendly statements are often confused by people and considered to be symptops of a confused mind.</p>

<p>It is rational to change what one believes under the light of new information (<em>.i.e. Bayes rule</em>). However, most people usually stick to their ideas. This behavior can be explained by evolutionary arguments (<em>as most things</em>): &quot;Think about the consequences of being a trader outside of the market activity, and deciding every morning at 8 a.m. whether to keep the spouse or part with him or her for a better emotional investment elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Researchers found that purely rational behavior on the part of humans can come from a defect in the amygdala that blocks the emotions of attachment, meaning that the subject is, literally, a pscyopath.&quot;</p>

<p>Mild success can be explained by skills and labor.
Wild success is attrituable to variance.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to optimize a lot, introducing variance and randomness into life has benefits. Taleb argues that the life is more enjoyable without optimizing.</p>

<p>Taleb made heavy use of Monte Carlo methods in his career. He thinks mathematics is not sufficient for understanding complex events. Mathematics is a tool to &quot;meditate&quot; for him.</p>

<p>Taleb considers himself a stoic, who endures the unpleasent random events of life.</p>
