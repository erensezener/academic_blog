          <h2>Motor Control Research and Moore's Law</h2>
<p class="meta">20 Jan 2015</p>

<div class="post">
<p>These days I am reading and contemplating about what to focus on for the next 5-6 years of my life during a PhD program. My interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and computational neuroscience. One thing I have noticed in my readings is that the topic of Motor Control is vastly underdeveloped compared to Computer Vision. There are a lot of papers which indicate their methods are superior to other methods based on a random benchmarking task using random algorithm implementations. I believe it is easier to publish papers this way but I also believe Motor Control community can really benefit from creating standard benchmarks (similar to ImageNet in Computer Vision). I understand that it is not as straightforward to create a benchmark test for robotics tasks such as manipulation or locomotion using real robot hardware. However, I believe that the focus of the robotics community (particularly motor control) should shift from creating cookie-cutter robot implementations to using simulations for complex tasks. This would save robotics researchers a lot of time and money. I also understand that &quot;simulations are doomed to succeed&quot;. However, it seems silly to spend a lot of time using robot hardware if the terminal goal of a reseracher is to create human-level intelligence. The time and effort required to teach a robot arm to play ping pong using reinforcement learning is like 1000x more than doing the same thing in simulation.</p>

<p>In short, I think motor control researchers could reap the benefits of Moore&#39;s Law by relying more on simulations or <a href="http://lukemuehlhauser.com/wp-content/uploads/Lehman-Miikkulainen-General-Video-Game-Playing-as-a-Benchmark-for-Human-Competitive-AI.pdf">video games</a> to develop human-level intelligence.</p>

<p>PS: This is a topic that blows mind for quite a time. One reason I wrote this blog post is to  actively think about this topic. So please take my opinions with a grain of salt. </p>
