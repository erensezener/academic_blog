These days I am reading and contemplating about what to focus on for the next 5-6 years of my life during a PhD program. One thing I have noticed in my readings is that the topic of Motor Control is vastly underdeveloped compared to Computer Vision. There are a lot of papers which indicate their methods are superior to other methods based on a random benchmarking task using random algorithm implementations. I believe it is easier to publish papers this way but I also believe Motor Control community can really benefit from creating standard benchmarks (similar to ImageNet in Computer Vision). I understand that it is not as straightforward to create benchmarks for robotics tasks such as manipulation or locomotion using real robot hardware. However, I believe that the focus of the robotics (particularly motor control) community should shift from creating cookie-cutter robot implementations to using simulations for complex tasks. This would save robotics researchers a lot of time and money. I also understand that "simulations are doomed to succeed". However, it seems silly to spend a lot of time using robot hardware if the terminal goal of a reseracher is to create human-level intelligence. For example, the time and effort required to teach a robot arm to play ping pong using reinforcement learning is like 1000x more than doing the same thing in simulation.

In short, I think motor control researchers could reap the benefits of Moore's Law by relying more on simulations or [video games](http://lukemuehlhauser.com/wp-content/uploads/Lehman-Miikkulainen-General-Video-Game-Playing-as-a-Benchmark-for-Human-Competitive-AI.pdf) to develop human-level intelligence.

PS: This is a topic that intrigues me for quite a time. One reason I wrote this blog post is to  actively think about this topic. So please take my opinions with a grain of salt.
