**Note:** This article is not completed yet. It is brewing.

At a given day, I visit tens if not hundreds of web pages. Often, I try to retrieve information from my memory about the things I have read online. I can usually remember some fragments of the original text. If I am lucky, after few Google search queries, I find the web page I am looking for. If I am not lucky, after exhausting all the search queries related to what I remember, I become very annoyed and give up.

That's why I started to archive the web pages that I might want to revisit using the [Evernote][Evernote Web Site]. I have Evernote premium membership which grants me 1GB of uploads per month. Average size of a web site was 1.3 MB in 2012[1]. Let's be generous and assume it is 2MB now. This means that we can upload 500 web pages to Evernote [1].

I use [Evernote Web Clipper][ewc] for saving full or partial web pages. For the most part, I only save the text that is of value to me. This both saves upload quota, and saves my Evernote archive from clutter. As you can see below, Evernote Web Clipper provides many useful options.

####Few Tips for Using the Clipper
- **Article** option is used for saving only the main text. It usually works nicely, but not all the time.
- **Full Page** option saves the whole page.
- If a text is selected with cursor before clipping, clipper can save the selected text. This is especially useful if you are interested in just a section of the wab page. (e.g. I used it for saving Quora posts)

Overall, archiving web pages with Evernote works fine for me. However, an application that saves all the visited web pages as a simple text file (no images etc.) would prove useful. It would somehow be the index of one's browsing history. In a way, one would easily be able to find previously visited web sites by searching via keywords or regular expressions.
