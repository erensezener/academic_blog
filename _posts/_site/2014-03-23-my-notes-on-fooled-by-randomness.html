<p>I enjoyed reading the book. Altough most concepts were not new to me, Taleb offers some refreshing insights. </p>

<p>Main argument of the book is that most things in life are random. However, people don’t see the randomness and find causal connections.
Taleb bashes the academics, scientists, and especially traders for being fools of randomess.</p>

<p>Below, I list some of my notes from the book:</p>

<p><em>Please note that, my notes do not necessarily reflect my beliefs but they some likely include my interpretations.</em></p>

<p>Taleb avoids watching or reading any news. He considers most news as noise.</p>

<p>Arguments that cannot be simplified into media-friendly statements are often confused by people and considered to be symptops of a confused mind.</p>

<p>It is rational to change what one believes under the light of new information (<em>.i.e. Bayes rule</em>). However, most people usually stick to their ideas. This behavior can be explained by evolutionary arguments (<em>as most things</em>): “Think about the consequences of being a trader outside of the market activity, and deciding every morning at 8 a.m. whether to keep the spouse or part with him or her for a better emotional investment elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Researchers found that purely rational behavior on the part of humans can come from a defect in the amygdala that blocks the emotions of attachment, meaning that the subject is, literally, a pscyopath.”</p>

<p>Mild success can be explained by skills and labor.
Wild success is attrituable to variance.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to optimize a lot, introducing variance and randomness into life has benefits. Taleb argues that the life is more enjoyable without optimizing.</p>

<p>Taleb made heavy use of Monte Carlo methods in his career. He thinks mathematics is not sufficient for understanding complex events. Mathematics is a tool to “meditate” for him.</p>

<p>Taleb considers himself a stoic, who endures the unpleasent random events of life.</p>
